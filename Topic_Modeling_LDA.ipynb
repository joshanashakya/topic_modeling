But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art.\n"

      "It's hard to believe \"Memory of Trees\" came out 11 years ago;it has held up well over the passage of time.It's Enya's last great album before the New Age/pop of \"Amarantine\" and \"Day without rain.\" Back in 1995,Enya still had her creative spark,her own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album;it is melancholy,bittersweet,from the opening title song.\"Memory of Trees\" is elegaic&majestic.;\"Pax Deorum\" sounds like it is from a Requiem Mass,it is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a \"disconcerting\" blend of spirituality&sensuality;,I don't find it disconcerting at all.\"Anywhere is\" is a hopeful song,looking to possibilities.\"Hope has a place\" is about love,but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic,platonic,etc.I've always had a soft spot for this song.\"On my way home\" is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age music,a must for any Enya fan!\n",
